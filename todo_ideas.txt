relays can be a neat way to achieve recursive turing machines. 
to avoid endless pipelining, use the consume history of the machine 
modernize the cpp used (optimization)
concurrent excecution for independent machine tree topologies 
shift errors to compile time (in C++)
tape name clash

remove consumes? (anyway relay will get the topological sorting job done , consumes can be a entry 
restricting mechanism , but seems very unncessary)
graph cycles aren't currently detected

compilation flags 
- perf
- debug //support this 
- transparent ordering
