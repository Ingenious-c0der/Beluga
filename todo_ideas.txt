relays can be a neat way to achieve recursive turing machines. 
to avoid endless pipelining, use the consume history of the machine 
machines are currently executed currently in serial manner as they appear, can be changed with adding a run construct
modernize the cpp used (optimization)
concurrent excecution for independent machine tree topologies
