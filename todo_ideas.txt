relays can be a neat way to achieve recursive turing machines. 
modernize the cpp used (optimization)

concurrent excecution for independent machine tree topologies 
shift errors to compile time (in C++)

machine imports 

remove consumes? (anyway relay will get the topological sorting job done , consumes can be a entry 
restricting mechanism , but seems very unncessary)

console input

compilation flags 
- perf // check memory leaks and runtimes for each stage
- debug //support this 
- transparent ordering 

on accept/ on reject => give ability to write <lambda>functions or short aggregators

add flag to visualize turing machine using light weight graphics library
