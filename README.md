- Beluga Language

Beluga Language is an esoteric language based on fundamental implementations of a turing machine. 
As of now, its in active development, and mimics the model of a Linear Bounded Automata and sooner that of a general 
turing machine(with finite tape). 

The language is designed to be simple, and easy to understand. In theory , it is capable of solving any problem that can be solved by a turing machine/ digital computer. Beluga supports multi tape turing machines

The language uses C++ for compilation, so you need a C++ compiler to compile beluga code.
